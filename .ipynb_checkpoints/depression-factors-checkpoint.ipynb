    "Major **depression** is one of the most common mental illnesses, affecting 6.7% (more than 16 million) of American adults each year and is widely spread among students. A lack of sleep, poor eating habits, and not enough exercise are a recipe for depression among college students. The stress that comes with academia — including financial worries, pressure to get a good job after school, and failed relationships — is enough to force some students to leave college or worse. For that reason, I have chosen depression among international students in United States to be the topic of my projects. I will base my simulated/synthesised dataset on the research paper on the topic as follows: *Predictors of Depression and Anxiety Among International Students*, written by Seda Sümer, Senel Poyrazli, and Kamini Grahame."

    "International students are often facing difficulties adjusting to new social and educational environment, which is causing aditional stress. This changes are sometimes followed by cultural shocks, language barriers, homesickness and other social difficulties. All of these circumstances lead to isolation and lonliness and in many cases, depression.  \n",
    "It is very important that those who do experience depression get all the support and help they need and that's why it is essential to raise awareness about this problem and try to recognise the causes, in order to prevent the same.  \n",
    "Therefore, we will analyse the potential causes of depression and their relationship with depression itself."
