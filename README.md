# Project assignment for Programming for Data Analysis module at GMIT
# December 2019
This document contains the Project assignment 2019 for Programming for Data Analysis modul at GMIT.  [see the instructions here](https://github.com/brianmcgmit/ProgDA/blob/master/ProgDA_Project.pdf)
The goal of this project is to create a data set by stimulating a real-world phenomenon of my own choice. I have decided to investigate the depression factors amongst international students, since I believe it is a big problem of the society nowadays. I will base my assumptions on the research paper *Predictors of Depression and Anxiety Among International Students*, (Seda SÃ¼mer, Senel Poyrazli, and Kamini Grahame).  
In the repository, you can find the Jupyter notebook containing the main body of the project and the list of references.  
In Part I. of the Jupyter notebook file, I will explain the research problem and the motivation behind it. Part II. will contain the explanation and creation of the variables I will use in my simulated/synthesised dataset. In the Part III. I will investigate the relationship between the variables in the dataset and their likely distributions and conclude the research.
